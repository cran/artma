#' Create Mock Study Names with Random Occurrences
#'
#' This function generates a specified number of unique mock study names and assigns
#' each study a random number of occurrences such that the sum of all occurrences equals
#' the specified total. If the total occurrences are less than the number of studies,
#' an error is thrown. Both inputs should be integers.
#'
#' @param n_studies Integer. Number of unique mock study names to create.
#' @param total_occurrences Integer. Total number of occurrences to distribute among the studies.
#'
#' @return A character vector with the study names repeated according to their assigned occurrences.
